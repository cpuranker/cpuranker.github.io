## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**CPURanker** is a Database of mobile CPUs, where you can easily find:
- CPU names + Model numbers
- GPU details
- Filter by CPU and GPU manufacturers
- Custom filters as Search Field
- Export your filtered data to a CSV file

Live page is hosted there https://cpuranker.github.io

## Why and who is this for?
- If you've ever tried managing devices in Google Play Console, you know it's not the most convenient tool.

## Whatâ€™s wrong with it?
- You canâ€™t upload a prepared file with the list of required devices or filters.
- Searching for specific CPUs can be a mess:
- Some CPUs are searchable by Product Name (e.g., Snapdragon 810)
- Others can only be found using their Model Number (e.g., SM8450 for Snapdragon 8 Gen 1)

This results in a long quest to find and filter the CPUs or GPUs you need.
It gets even harder if your game isnâ€™t fully optimized yet, but you need to run early tests. In this case, you may want to identify processors based on their performance metrics or other criteria.

## The solution:
What started as a Google Sheet has now evolved into a simple HTML/JS page where you can:
- Search for mobile CPUs
- Filter and sort based on CPU/GPU Manufacturer, Rank or Antutu Score
- Custom Filters as Search field
- Download your results in CSV format for further use

## Known issues:
- Some Model Numbers are marked as "Unknown." But this isnâ€™t a big problem because those processors can still be found by their names in Google Play Console.

## Future plans:
- Add a tab for GPU rankings (since device selection can also depend on GPU performance)
- Add new download formats
- Add filters for Rank and Antutu Score columns
- Add additional benchmarks for better comparisons
- Automate the process of fetching new CPUs and GPUs to keep the database up-to-date
